#This is a Python code that creates a simple calculator application that asks a user to enter 
#two numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that theyâ€™d like to perform on the numbers.
# Display the answer to the equation. Every equation entered by the user should be written to a text file. 
#Uses defensive programming ,this program  can  handles unexpected events and user inputs.
